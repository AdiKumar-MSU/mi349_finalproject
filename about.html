                        <p class="paragraph">I'm Adi, I'm a junior Information Science major attending Michigan State University. My goal is to get a career in fullstack web/app development, and an internship for the summer of 2024.

                        <br>
                        When I was a kid, I always had an interest in technology, and how it worked. I liked learning how to do things such as running emulators on my school Chromebook, or learning how to jailbreak a phone to download apps. I also learned programming by using the language/website Scratch, but as I got older, I knew I wanted to go into software development or programming as a job, but wasn't sure specifically what kind of work I wanted to do with it. I decided to enroll in Michigan State University for the major of Computer Science, when I realized that a lot of the coursework wasn't the right fit for me. I found out instead about Information Science, a field that is like CS but more customer facing and design-oriented. And in my junior year, I joined a club called Imagine Software as an app developer, giving me my first real experience working with a team to deliver a product that will someday be used by people. I have never been more excited about the future of my career, and I'm looking forward to my first internship experience in summer 2024!
